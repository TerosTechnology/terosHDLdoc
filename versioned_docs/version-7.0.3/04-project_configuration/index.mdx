# Setting up a Project

<DocCardList />


While it is possible to work without using TerosHDL projects, utilizing them unlocks the full range of functionalities. Once your project is set up, you can leverage the entire spectrum of features such as:

- Error checking.
- Jump to the definition of signals, ports, etc.
- Dependency viewer.
- Hierarchy.
- Running external tools: simulators, compilers...

In the following sections, you'll see how to create a project, add libraries/files, and everything necessary to manage it.
Here you can see a general workflow, but go to each section for more detailed information:
