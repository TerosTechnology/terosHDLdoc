# Virtual Bus

Virtual bus allows you to create additional documentation sections of groups of signals which are related.

Each virtual bus you'll define will create a new table like this:

</p>

Which was generated by the following verilog code:

```verilog
module virtualbus (
    //! @virtualbus m00_axi4_stream @dir in
    //! tdata of stream
    input [7:0] m00_tdata,
    //! valid of stream
    input   m00_tvalid,
    //! id of current message
    input [3:0] m00_tid,
    //! destination of packet
    input [3:0] m00_tdest,
    //! this device is ready to receive
    output reg m00_tready,
    //! @end

    input clk,
    input rstn
);

endmodule
```

:::note
by default, the documenter will use ```--! ``` (in VHDL) and ```//!``` (in Verilog) to recognize things to document.

## Virtual Bus Syntax

The syntax for the virtual bus is as follows

* To start a virtual bus, begin the group with ```//! @virtualbus BUSNAME``` and close the group with ```//! @end```

* after the BUSNAME, you can add a description for the virtual bus.

* To choose the direction of the virtual bus, add ``` @dir in``` or ``` @dir out``` respectively

* If you don't want the signals to be grouped in the block diagram, you can add ```@keepports```

* you can add description to each port in the virtual bus either Above or Inline with the port.
