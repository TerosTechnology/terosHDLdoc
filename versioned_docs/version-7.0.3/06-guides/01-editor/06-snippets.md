# Autocomplete and snippets

Code snippets are templates that make it easier to enter repeating code patterns, such as loops or conditional-statements.

In Visual Studio Code, snippets appear in IntelliSense (`Ctrl+Space`) mixed with other suggestions, as well as in a dedicated snippet picker (Insert Snippet in the Command Palette). There is also support for tab-completion: Enable it with `"editor.tabCompletion": "on"`, type a snippet prefix (trigger text), and press Tab to insert a snippet.

TerosHDL supports snippets for: VHD, Verilog/SV and TCL.
