# Code highlighting (syntax coloring)

Code highlighting is a feature found in most code editors that visually highlights different parts of a code based on their syntax or meaning. The purpose of code highlighting is to make it easier for developers to read and understand code by quickly identifying different elements such as keywords, variables, functions, comments, and more.

Code highlighting works by analyzing the structure of the code and applying a different color or style to each type of element based on its syntax.

Overall, code highlighting is a useful feature that helps developers read and write code more efficiently by providing a visual representation of the structure and syntax of the code.
