Getting started
===============

Code beautifier that allows you to beautify your source code. 

The code formatting is available in Visual Studio Code through the following shortcuts:

- On Windows: ``Shift + Alt + F``
- On Mac: ``Shift + Option + F``
- On Linux: ``Ctrl + Shift + I``

Alternatively, you can find the shortcut, as well as other shortcuts, through the 'Command Palette' provided in the editor 
with ``Ctrl +Shift+ P`` (or ``Command + Shift + P`` on Mac), and then searching for format document.

You can also click (make sure that the focus is in the text editor) on the icon provided by TerosHDL:
