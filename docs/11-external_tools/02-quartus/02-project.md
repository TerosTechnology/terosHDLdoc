# Project creation

To fully leverage the potential of Intel® Quartus® integration with TerosHDL, you need to create a Quartus®-type project. This can be achieved by either creating a new project or adding an existing one.

In both cases, once added to TerosHDL, all changes will be reflected when you open the Intel® Quartus® application.

## New Intel Quartus project

When you create a new project from scratch in TerosHDL, it will prompt you for the directory where the project will be saved, the name of the new project, the device family, and the device. The last two are based on the devices installed on your PC.
