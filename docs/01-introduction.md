</p>


The goal of TerosHDL is to provide an **open source toolbox** for HDL developers with functionalities commonly used by software developers. The IDE consist in a bunch of tools and on top of them is **VSCodium**/VSCode.
Some tools are developed by Teros Technology organization and others come from open source projects. All the tools are organized in different backends and exposed to the GUI with the plugin.

The IDE tries to be as much self-contained as possible and simplify the installation process.

- Support for VHDL/Verilog/SystemVerilog.
- Cross-platform: Linux, Mac, Windows.
- Real-time error checking.
- Smart templates for testbenches, entities...
- Automatic documentation generation.
- State machine viewer.
- Code formatter.
- Schematic viewer.
- And many editing utilities: syntax coloring, hover, name refactoring, code folding, evaluate literals...
