# Name refactoring

Renaming is a common operation related to refactoring source code and VS Code has a separate Rename Symbol command (`F2`). TerosHDL supports rename symbol across files. Press `F2` and then type the new desired name and press Enter. All usages of the symbol will be renamed, across files.

This feature is only supported on VHDL
