    <p><em><strong>"Adiuvo specialises in the development of FPGAs for space and other mission critical applications, over the last 12 months our editor of choice has become VSCode with the TerosHDL add in. FPGA developed for space and mission critical applications require not only a high quality of code but also detailed and correct supporting documentation. </strong></em></p>
    <p><em><strong>Using the TerosHDL add in we are able to include timing and register information within the RTL source code. The documentation features of TerosHDL then enable the creation of waveform diagrams, register maps, Block IP Block diagrams demonstrating interfaces along with of course FSM diagrams. These documentation features support developers as they create the supporting design documentation and design descriptions for design and certification reviews"</strong> </em></p>
