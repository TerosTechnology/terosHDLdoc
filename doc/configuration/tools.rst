Simulators and tools
====================

Simulators, tools and frameworks aren't provided by TerosHDL. You need to install it manually.

Tool configuration
------------------

Each tool/simulator has a tab to configure it. There you can set the custom path or the tool settings.

You don't need to configure the installation path if the tool is in the system path (you are allowed to launch it from
command line). Otherwise you need to set the installation path: folder where is located the tool binary.

Only the folder, not folder and binary name. E.g:

- ModelSim in Linux: /opt/intelFPGA_pro/20.1/modelsim_ase/bin
- GHDL in Linux: /usr/local/bin/

Make sure that the tool binary is located in the folder.
