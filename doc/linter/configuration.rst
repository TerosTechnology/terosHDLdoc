Configuration
=============

Open TerosHDL configuration panel and select your linter:

.. image:: images/configuration.png

.. important::

    If your linter (Vivado, GHDL, Icarus...) is in the system path (you can call it from command line) you don't need to set the installation directory.


Configure the installation **directory** of your selected linter. For example, if you are using GHDL:

.. image:: images/configuration2.png
