.. _schematic_viewer:

Verilog/SV beta schematic viewer
================================

This function can be used to show the Verilog/SV schematic. Be careful, this tool isn't a linter, you have to 
provide a code free of errors.

It's a good practice to try the `fpga4student <https://www.fpga4student.com/p/verilog-project.html>`_ basic blocks.
